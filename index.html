					<h3>John Nguyen, 99th Percentile SAT Tutor</h3>
					<p><img class="picture" src="profjohn.png">Hi! I am a college sophomore currently seeking my BS in Computer Science at The University of Texas at Dallas on a full-tuition merit-based scholarship. My SAT was in the 99.3% percentile with a 23/24 essay score. I'm a tech nerd with a passion for music: I have a published app on the Google Play store and I've won national awards as a rising flute soloist. Additionally, I have received academic recognitions including the Academic Excellence Scholarship with Distinction, AP Scholar with Distinction, Intel Andy Grove Scholarship, Beaverton Elks Foundation Scholarship, Association of Beaverton School District Administrators Scholarship, Beaverton Arts Foundation Scholarship, and the Oregon Music Hall of Fame Scholarship.
						<br>
						<br>
With nearly five years of experience, I formerly held a private contract with Varsity Tutors and was among their top 10% hand-picked tutors worldwide with a perfect 5.0-star rating. I am passionate about teaching and I focus especially on developing independent study habits. I develop personal relationships with my students and instill a lifelong excitement for learning. At the same time, I set high standards for my students, only expecting the best out of them while adjusting to their strengths, weaknesses, and pacing. My methods have helped top students improve scores up to 400 points and assisted students with disabilities, such as dyslexia and ADHD, realize their potential.</p>

					<h3>Rosie Nguyen, 99th Percentile SAT Tutor</h3>
					<p><img class="picture" src="profrosie.png">Hello! I am originally from Portland, OR, and am going into my third year at The University of Texas at Dallas on a full-tuition merit-based scholarship. I have interests in tech and business, seeking a BS in Information Technology with a minor in Marketing. I have received awards such as National Merit Commendation, AP Scholar with Distinction, Kiwanis Key Club Scholarship, Vietnamese Community of Oregon Scholarship, Intel Andy Grove Scholarship, and Academic Excellence Scholarship with Honors.
					<br> <br>
					In high school I received a 1550 (750 Reading and 800 Math) on the SAT and 33 on the ACT. I then started tutoring for fun, helping my siblings and friends and eventually moving to the Varsity Tutors platform. I have been tutoring for over two years now, maintaining a 5-star rating with dozens of students. I specialize in Math and SAT Prep, but have helped in other subjects including Excel, Powerpoint, and Study Habits. My students have all done exceptionally well on their tests, experiencing increases in grade and SAT scores; my top students have seen over a 400 point difference. My goal is to connect and build relationships with them in order to maximize their capabilities and help them grow. Working on habits and skills with them will also translate into important traits used in college and the workplace.
					<br> <br>
					Looking forward to hearing from you soon :)</p>

				<div class="testimonials_slide">
					<p>"My son and I are very impressed with John! He works really hard with him and wants to see him succeed and do well. Quite impressive for his age. He's smart and knows his material and knows how to implement them for my son. My son is busy with extracurriculars and AP classes and John knows this so he gives him a reasonable amount of challenging homework. We are very happy with John and I think you would be too!!" - Nancy F.  </p>
				</div>
				<div class="testimonials_slide">
					<p>"Dani really liked John. He made her feel at ease and helped her a lot with problems she had difficulty completing. It was a good match. He is such a great fit for my daughter. She has learned a lot and it's only been two sessions" - Daniella C. </p>
				</div>
				<div class="testimonials_slide">
					<p>"What an amazing, conscientious, thoughtful and hard working tutor!!! Don't let his age scare you. John was born to teach, help and assist others. He takes complete pride in his work and wants every single student to succeed. He is able to focus on their individual needs and areas they need to improve upon. He understands that they are busy with school work or extra curricular activities so he tries to keep homework assignments reasonable. If he's pushing your child it's because it's crunch time and only temporary! I find my son listens better to John telling him to work hard rather than me :) You will not be disappointed with John. He's the best tutor we have had to date. Now, basically, it's up to our kids to execute what he's trying to help them learn." - Nancy F. </p>

					<p>"Great sessions! We worked on all sorts of different tips. Whether it was writing and language tips or just math tips on how to find midpoint. I have been incredibly happy with Rosie and the quality of tutoring. She is excellent." - Braden A.</p>

				<div class="testimonials_slide">
					<p>"Rosemarie is extremely helpful, and is an amazing tutor! She helps you if you're stuck but doesn't give you the answer. She walks you through a process and lets you try and figure the problem out on your own. She's extremely patient and has helped explain everything I get wrong on the practice tests." - Kaitlyn G.</p>

				<p id="heading">Join Our Family.</p>
				<p>As the oldest siblings of a large family, we understand the magnitude of standardized tests on admissions decisions and we take responsibility for our student outcomes. We commit our hearts to all our students, inspiring and motivating them to success. Throughout our years of experience, we have learned the SAT inside and out. We've learned to pinpoint our students' weaknesses and check in with the parents to understand our students better, and provide additional workshops, presentations, and proctored exams on our own unpaid time. Every student is expected to work very hard.  
					<br>
					<br>
Modeled after the wisdom from Tom Fishgrund's groundbreaking study of perfect SAT scoring students, our approach is more than just an SAT boost. We provide the critical support our students need to spark an intellectual curiosity that naturally correlates to high performance on the SAT. Our students attain a voracious excitement for learning and a passion for following their interests. They learn to excel in the SAT and apply those same lessons of dedication, self-motivation, and grit to their life. They learn to be proactive and create opportunities for themselves and for members of their community.
					<br>
					<br>
We value all our students regardless of race, ethnicity, nationality, religion, sexual orientation, ability, gender identity, or age. Joining our tutoring family means that we will deeply care about your personal and academic goals. We periodically switch off on teachers to ensure that every student will experience a fresh approach to the SAT and connection to us in order to foster a supportive learning environment. </p>

			<div id="better-score">
				<p id="heading">Better Score Guarantee.</p>
				<p>We personally guarantee an improvement on your SAT or you will receive all your money back, no questions asked. The improvement margin will be measured by your first official College Board exam score you ever took or by the first exam score you take with us during a proctored exam session to the College Board official test.
					<br>
					<br>
	Keep in mind, this is the bare minimum that we guarantee. Most of our students do much better than that with incredible score improvements up by 400 points.</p>
