					<h3>John Nguyen, 99th Percentile SAT Tutor</h3>
					<p><img class="picture" src="profjohn.png">Hi! I am a college sophomore currently seeking my BS in Computer Science at The University of Texas at Dallas on a full-tuition merit-based scholarship. My SAT was a 1510 (99.3% percentile) and 23/24 essay score. I'm a tech nerd with a passion for music: I have a published app on the Google Play store and I've received national awards as a rising flute soloist. Additionally, I have received academic awards including the Academic Excellence Scholarship with Distinction, AP Scholar with Distinction, Andy Grove Scholarship for Intel Employee's Children, Beaverton Elks Foundation Scholarship, Association of Beaverton School District Administrators Scholarship, Beaverton Arts Foundation Scholarship, and the Oregon Music Hall of Fame Scholarship.
						<br>
						<br>
With nearly five years of experience, I formerly held a private contract with Varsity Tutors and was among their top 10% hand-picked tutors worldwide with a perfect 5.0-star rating. I am passionate about teaching students and I focus especially on developing independent study habits. I develop personal relationships with my students and instill a lifelong excitement for learning. At the same time, I set high standards for my students, always expecting the best out of them while adjusting to their strengths, weaknesses, and pacing. My methods have helped top students improve scores up to 300 points and assisted students with disabilities, including dyslexia and ADHD, realize their potential.</p>

					<h3>Rosie Nguyen, 99th Percentile SAT Tutor</h3>
					<p><img class="picture" src="profrosie.png">Hello! I am originally from Portand, OR, and am going into my third year at The University of Texas at Dallas on a full-tuition merit-based scholarship. I have interests in tech and business, seeking a BS in Information Technology with a minor in Marketing. I have received awards such as National Merit Commendedation, AP Scholar with Distinction, Kiwanis Key Club Scholarship, Vietnamese Community of Oregon Scholarship, Intel Andy Grove Scholarship, and Academic Excellence Scholarship with Honors.
					<br> <br>
					In high school I received a 1550 (750 Reading and 800 Math) on the SAT and 33 on the ACT. I then started tutoring for fun, helping my siblings and friends and eventually moving to the Varsity Tutors platform. I have been tutoring for over two years now, maintaining a 5-star rating with dozens of students. I specialize in Math and SAT Prep, but have helped in other subjects including Excel, Powerpoint, and Study Habits. My students have all done well on their tests, experiencing increases in grade and SAT scores; my top students have seen over a 300 point difference. My goal is to connect and build relationships with them in order to maximize their capabilities and help them grow. Working on habits and skills with them will  also translate into important traits used in college and the workplace.
					<br> <br>
					Looking forward to hearing from you soon :)</p>

				<p id="heading">Join Our Family.</p>
				<p>As the oldest siblings of a large family, we take responsibility in being a good role model for our siblings. Our tutoring approach is similar: we connect, uplift, inspire our students to success. We understand the impact a personal relationship has on another student and we work seriously to provide personal mentorship on our own time. 
					<br>
					<br>
As a member of our family, we will work with everything we can to help you acheive your goals. We also will switch off on teachers periodically to ensure every student receives their ideal tutor, experiences a differentiated instruction, and connects to each of us on a personal level. </p>

			<div id="better-score">
				<p id="heading">Better Score Guarantee.</p>
				<p>We can personally guarantee an improvement on your SAT practice exams, or all your money back. If you have already taken an exam and received an official score, we personally guarantee that you will get a better score or you will receive all your money back. 
					<br>
					<br>
Most of our students do much better that than that, though. They score with improvements up to 300 points.</p>
